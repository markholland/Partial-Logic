Here you can find some things that I've worked on recently.


- QTJambi is a no longer developed implementation of QT in java, we have to use it at university so here are the last 2 things I made with it. The worst thing about QTJambi is you have to packet all the libraries with the jar and also it will only work on Windows.

**Android Port Scanner**

- Just a quick port of a cli java port scanner, has many bugs so don't bother telling me about them, was mainly just to give some dazzle to the class presentation.
