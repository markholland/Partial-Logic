<p>Here you can find some things that I've worked on recently.</p>

<ul>
<li>QTJambi is a no longer developed implementation of QT in java, we have to use it at university so here are the last 2 things I made with it. The worst thing about QTJambi is you have to packet all the libraries with the jar and also it will only work on Windows.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Android Port Scanner</strong></p>
