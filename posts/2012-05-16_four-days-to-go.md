#4 days to go

4 days until the #gsoc coding period officially starts. I haven’t had a chance to do much preparation yet but that should change from tomorrow. I’ve set the, in theory, easier to implement functions at the beginning of my timeline so progress should be noticeable very soon, also once things start being completed the updates here should pick up.
