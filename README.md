Partial-Logic
=============

My website!

Runs on PHP and CSS3, posts are written in markdown and there is no database, the entire site comes in at under 5MB.

It also has an RSS feed and a JSON read-only API. 

The screen adapts automatically to size, to see, try portrait and landscape on a tablet.

Feel free to use and adapt to your liking.
